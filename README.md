# aframe-billboard-component #

a simple "billboard" component for A-Frame

Three.js [Sprites](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Sprite) are planes which always face the camera - but sometimes, the vertical axis of such objects should keep pointing upwards, regardless of the current camera position: that's what "billboards" are good for.

`aframe-billboard-component` implements a simple billboard component for [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).

**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/aframe-billboard-component/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)

> Just a small note: if you like this work and plan to use it, consider "starring" this repository (you will find the "Star" button on the top right of this page), so that I know which of my repositories to take most care of.
