# aframe-billboard-component #

a simple "billboard" component for A-Frame

Three.js [Sprites](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Sprite) are planes which always face the camera - but sometimes, the vertical axis of such objects should keep pointing upwards, regardless of the current camera position: that's what "billboards" are good for.

`aframe-billboard-component` implements a simple billboard component for [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).
